Watermelon Linux is free, open source software. It's sctrictly community maintained, with a general set of rules stated below. Failiure to comply with these rules will prevent you from contributing to the Watermelon Linux project.

1. Before setting your files in with the main release, add a tarball of it into the tarball branch of the respitory. This helps back up the distrobution.

2. Do not remove files. I'm not going to explain how to. Leave it too the project leaders please. If you think a file should be removed, either write it on the source forge page forums, explaining why you think it should be removed.

3. Do not mess with the ISO branch. It' for COMPLETED VERSIONS ONLY. For alpha and beta builds, check the other-builds branch.

4. You can aply to be a an administrator on the sourceforge page. It's under the 'roles' category.
